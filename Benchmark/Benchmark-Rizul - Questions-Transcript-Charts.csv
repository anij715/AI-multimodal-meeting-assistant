P9_P10_part6.docx,Participant 9's conclusion that the box plot is 'misleading' is based on a multimodal comparison between:,The small font size of the genre labels and the title of the chart.,The visual representation of this chart (where all genre medians look similar) and their memory of previous charts (where some genres were clearly higher grossing).,The key on the right-hand side and the actual box plots.,The color of the box plots and their personal preferences for those colors.,b,"The judgment of the chart being ""misleading"" comes from a conflict between the visual information it presents (genres look similar) and the visual/textual information recalled from previous charts, which showed clear differences.",Participant State Analysis,Data Pattern,

P9_P10_part7.docx,Participant 9 questions the visual accuracy of the density curve by pointing out a multimodal inconsistency. What is it?,The curve is a different color than the histogram bars.,The textual title of the chart does not mention a density curve.,"The visual curve does not pass through the midpoint of each visual bar, which conflicts with their textual understanding of how it should be plotted.",The y-axis scale is too large for a density curve.,c,"This requires understanding a sophisticated critique where the participant compares the visual evidence (the line's path) against their internal, text-based knowledge of the statistical rule for plotting such a curve.",Participant State Analysis,Visual Properties,
P9_P10_part7.docx,Participant 9's initial statement that the main graph 'doesn't really make sense' is because it's missing a key piece of text that would allow them to interpret the visual data. What is that missing text?,The scale of the y-axis.,A label specifying which genre is being represented.,The title of the chart.,A legend explaining the color blue.,b,This question focuses on how the absence of a single textual element (a genre label) renders the entire visual representation (the histogram) meaningless or inconclusive for the user.,Factual Recall,Participant Hypothesis,
P9_P10_part8.docx,The participants reason that science fiction films require a higher budget because of special effects and post-processing. This is a multimodal inference where:,They analyze the colors of the data points in the science fiction plot.,"They use external, text-based knowledge about film production to explain the visual clustering of data points in the high-budget area of the chart.",They read the chart's title and legend very carefully.,They compare the science fiction scatter plot to the comedy scatter plot.,b,"This tests the ability to understand that the participants are explaining a visual pattern (data clustered on the high-budget side) by applying external, conceptual knowledge from another domain (film production).",Participant State Analysis,Participant Hypothesis,

P7_P8_part2.docx,The participants' discussion about the '1e9' symbol reveals a multimodal failure they perceive in the chart's design. What is this failure?,The symbol is visually too small to read.,The textual choice of a scientific symbol ('1e9') conflicts with the chart's inferred textual goal of being simple for a general audience to interpret.,The color of the symbol does not match the color of the revenue bars.,"The participants believe the symbol visually represents millions, not billions.",b,"This question links their textual critique ('doesn't make it simple') to the specific visual choice of a textual element ('1e9'), identifying a conflict between the visual encoding and the chart's intended purpose.",Data Interpretation,Visual Properties,

P7_P8_part3.docx,The participants' theory that the dollar values might be adjusted for inflation is a textual hypothesis prompted by observing what specific visual feature?,"The jagged, volatile nature of the line graph in the early years.",The use of a logarithmic scale on the y-axis.,The unexpected visual similarity in the y-axis position of a data point from the 1930s and data points from 2017.,The title of the chart explicitly mentioning that the data is adjusted for inflation.,c,"The conclusion about inflation is a direct attempt to explain a surprising visual feature: that a point from the 1930s is visually as high as modern points, which seems impossible without adjustment.",Participant State Analysis,Participant Hypothesis,
P7_P8_part3.docx,Participant 8's textual theory about movies becoming an 'everyday activity' is used to explain what specific change in the line's visual character after the 1980s?,The color of the line changes from blue to green.,The line becomes perfectly horizontal with no variation.,The visual amplitude of the line's up-and-down swings becomes significantly smaller and more stable.,The line begins to trend downwards instead of upwards.,c,"This requires connecting a textual, socio-historical theory ('everyday activity') to the specific visual property it is meant to explain (a decrease in the line's visual volatility).",Causal & Process Analysis,Participant Hypothesis,

P5_P6_part6.docx,Participant 6 dismisses P5's difficulty seeing the median line as a 'monitor issue.' This interaction highlights a multimodal challenge where:,A subjective visual perception issue is attributed to a technical/environmental factor rather than a universal design flaw.,The participants disagree on the statistical meaning of the median line.,The chart's textual key is insufficient to explain the visual elements.,The box plot format is inherently flawed for displaying color.,a,This question links the text ('monitor issue') to the visual problem (contrast) and frames it as a classic user feedback challenge where personal experience conflicts with another's interpretation of the design's effectiveness.,Participant State Analysis,Participant Hypothesis,
